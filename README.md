### <div align="center">My name is Logan Vincent.  This is my main personal account.  I am a curious and open to new experiences and I'd love to learn something from you.</div>  
  

## I Am Currently Working On:
- Building a proper portfolio website.  

- Researching and planning for an app for a small business concerning dogs.

- A website for guided introspection.

## Some of My Recent Work:
- [Escape the House!](https://pewpewpew-fe.herokuapp.com/) This simple puzzle/maze game was a front-end and back-end team collaboration in which we challenged ourselves to build something new to us, with technologies we were unfamiliar with.  The front-end was built with React and Redux.  The back-end was built using Python and PostgreSQL.  Check out the repo's [here](https://github.com/PewPewPewTuring).
  
  
  
### A Little About Me:

- ðŸ’¡ Short term plans:  <br> I am currently an associate engineer with Wells Fargo, but I am now actively considering other opportunites.  I have mostly been implementing infrastructure code and working with Microsoft Azure, but I wouldn't mind returning to Frontend development, full stack or backend roles.  Know of any good opportunities?  Feel free to message [me](https://linkedin.com/in/logan-vincent)!     
  
- ðŸ’¡ Interests:  <br> I am fascinated by many things, especially science.  In particular I enjoy learning about physics, engineering, computer science and mathematics.  I love to be outdoors and often go hiking, camping, running, swimming, snowboarding/skiing, snowshoeing, exploring or just relaxing outside with my wife and our two dogs.  I love working with my hands and building/fixing things.  I have also been intrigued by human health & physiology since my first class in highschool.  
 
- Values: <br> 
  - I am a proponent of living a healthy lifestyle and do my best to support the physical and mental health of family, friends, coworkers, acquaintances or anyone else in need. 
     
  - I believe all people are equally valid and should be treated with fairness, respect and acceptance of who they are.  Seeking to understand and support each individual and their differences provides an opportunity for humanity to increase our capabilities and become stronger, smarter, healthier and more effective. 
   
  - I am a strong believer (and have yet to be swayed from the belief) that there is something valuable to learn from every individual I interact with.  This is true regardless of personal orientation, skill level, status, attitude or how intelligent, social, cheerful, wary, bitter, angry, jaded, unpleasant, uncooperative or negative that person may seem.
    
    
### My Non-Development Projects In the Works:  <br>
  - Building my own speakers.

  - Remodeling my kitchen.
  
  - Creating custom home automation using Raspberry Pi. <br>
